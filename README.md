# 2UP-html-test
Hi 2-UP team!
My name is Sergey and this is my attempt to finish your test task for a chance to take the front-end course.
I'd appreciate any feedback because this was my first time ever working with PSD and converting it to HTML/CSS.
I did not use JS, however, I coded some additional features from JS section using pure CSS. Hope you like it.

Thanks and have a good day!
Sergey :)
