# 2UP-html-test
Hi stranger :)
My name is Sergey and this is project was my first attempt to use HTML/CSS. 
I'd appreciate any feedback because this was my first time ever working with PSD and converting it to HTML/CSS.
I used a test task from 2up web studio as a guideline (can be found here: https://github.com/2UP/html-test). I did not use JS, however, I coded some additional features from JS section using pure CSS. Hope you like it.
Now I plan to modify this project a bit to check my progress over past two month. 

Build: gulp build

Thanks and have a good day!
Sergey :)
